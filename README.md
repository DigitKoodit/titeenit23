This website contains general information for the event, the schedule and the sponsors.

> Titeenit, or the Battle of the Titens, is an event that brings together all the information technology guilds in Finland. Titeenit are held in a different city every year, and this year Turku has the honor of hosting the event. The weekend will kick off on Friday with a day of hanging out and getting to know each other. The main event, however, will be Saturday's Titeeni-events, where the IT- towns will compete against each other in the most tricky competitions. There will be one judge from each city, who will decide on the distribution of points. At the end of the day, the winner of the 2023 Battle of Titens will be announced!
